# Test Article

## Overview

This is a test article written in Markdown format. It's much simpler than LaTeX or Typst!

## Mathematical Foundations

### Basic Concepts

Mathematics can be expressed inline like $f(x) = x^2$ or in display mode:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$

### Advanced Topics

We can also write more complex equations:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$

## Code Examples

### JavaScript

```javascript
const calculate = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

### Python

```python
def process_data(items):
    return [item * 2 for item in items]
```

## Lists and Tables

### Unordered List
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Ordered List
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Conclusion

Markdown is great for technical writing without the complexity!
